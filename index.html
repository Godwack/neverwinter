<p>These tools are intended to assist <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a> players.  The tools are targeted at the PC release of the game, and may be out of sync with the Xbox and PS4 releases.  However, items exclusive to the Xbox or PS4 releases are included.</p>

<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-dye/">Dye Pack Comparer</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for doing side-by-side comparisons of dye packs.  Note that the base colour of your equipment determines the result of the dyeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-dye-sort/">Dye Sort</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for sorting dye packs by luminance or hue.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-insignia/">Mount Insignia Bonuses</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for finding which mounts can match which insignia bonuses.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-combo/">Insignia Bonus Combos</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for trying to match mount insignia bonuses when you have very few insignia.  It's not useful once you have a lot of mount insignia.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-bonding/">Companion Bonding</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for ranking companions.  Setting any of the scores to -1 will exclude all companions that have that aspect.  Note that the "Estimated Speed" is often quite wrong.</td></tr>
